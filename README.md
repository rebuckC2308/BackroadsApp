# React 18 Tutorial & Projects Course (2023)

## Project 1: Backroads App

### Description:
- This project's purpose was to quickly convert a HTML/CSS project into a React one

- This project allowed me to review a lot of the basics surrounding React and was a good refresher.  It allowed me to review iterating over lists of data in React and reminded me to provide a key that allows React to 'track' those individual items.
